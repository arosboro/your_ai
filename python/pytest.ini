# Markers for test categorization
markers =
    unit: Unit tests (fast, isolated)
    integration: Integration tests (slower, requires setup)
    performance: Performance benchmark tests
    slow: Tests that take significant time to run
    requires_mlx: Tests that require MLX arrays and Apple Silicon (expensive on CI)
    requires_model: Tests that require loading actual models (very expensive)
    requires_training: Tests that involve actual training (extremely expensive)
    ci_safe: Tests safe to run on CI (abstractions, mocks, minimal compute)
